## Introduction
The ability to predict movie rental durations can provide significant insights into customer behavior and demand patterns. This project utilizes historical rental data and explores how various features influence rental duration, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset Description
- **Source**: The dataset includes historical movie rental information.
- **Key Features**:
  - Customer demographics
  - Movie genres
  - Rental timestamps
  - Ratings and reviews
  - Late return indicators
- **Target Variable**: Rental duration in days.

## Project Objectives
1. Analyze and preprocess the dataset for training.
2. Explore correlations and trends in movie rental durations.
3. Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
4. Evaluate the model's performance and interpret key findings.
5. Provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Summarize key statistics and visualize data trends.
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Normalize and encode categorical variables.
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create meaningful features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Building**:
   - Train various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
   - Use grid search or cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².

## Results
- The final model achieved high accuracy with an RMSE of approximately XX and an R² score of YY.
- Key drivers of rental duration include:
  - Movie genre
  - Customer rental history
  - Day of the week of rental initiation

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in predicting movie rental durations. By understanding key factors influencing rental patterns, rental businesses can enhance inventory management and customer satisfaction.

## Future Work
1. Incorporate external data, such as weather or holiday schedules, to improve predictions.
2. Explore deep learning models for enhanced accuracy.
3. Develop a user-friendly dashboard to visualize predictions and insights.
